# Section B: Detailed Datasheet (Datasheets for Datasets)

## Collection Process
Collection process details are not explicitly encoded in this JSON dataset and should be documented by dataset maintainers in future revisions.

## Preprocessing / Cleaning / Labeling
The dataset appears to be pre-structured by knowledge area with competency records containing title, description, taxonomy, sourceId, and version fields.

## Uses
Potential uses include curriculum mapping, competency gap analysis, and as a structured reference for educational ML/NLP workflows. This datasheet does not validate downstream model suitability.

## Distribution
This report was generated from a local JSON file and can be redistributed as PDF/Markdown/JSON outputs.

## Maintenance
Recommended maintenance: version dataset snapshots, monitor schema drift, and re-run this generator in CI for each update.
